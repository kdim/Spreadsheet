Spreadsheet
===========

Simple spreadsheet calculator to show my code ability for employer.

It's not using any 3side library except Google Mock/Test because I got used to it.

This code can:
* Make spreadsheet of string, float-point and expression value
* In expression avialable +,-,*,/,cos,sin with mathematical order of execution
* Detects many errors|typos in expressions

There are many simplification to get code small and simple and sometimes because of not using boost etc.
